            Note: This simple and humble sandwich is a classic British creation that dates back to the Victorian era, when it was often eaten by the working class as a cheap and filling meal. You can also experiment with adding different fillings, such as cheese or sliced tomatoes, to make it more flavorful. Enjoy!
